```javascript
//pages/about.js

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>About Page</div>
  );
}
```
No changes to the index.js file are needed.  The problem was not in the code itself, but the way Next.js handles initial requests vs. subsequent ones.  Simply the existence of the `pages/about.js` file is sufficient, and no further adjustments are needed in the code to fix the issue.
